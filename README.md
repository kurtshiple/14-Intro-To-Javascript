# JavaScript-and-DOM-Manipulation-for-Alien-Sightings
The purpose of this project was to create a basic HTML web page that listens for events and filters and appends a table based on the date/time column of a dataset related to alien sightings. 

More specifically, this involved creating a basic HTML web page, using a UFO dataset in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, writing code that would append a table to the web page, and then adding new rows of data for each UFO sighting.


This table features columns for date/time, city, state, country, shape, and comments.
The project uses a date form in the HTML document, JavaScript code that will listen for events, and search through the date/time column to find rows that match user input.
